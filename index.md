title: Websites with Python Flask

This is the course content for Websites with Python Flask, which has been developed and maintained by OpenTechSchool.

# Welcome

Hi, welcome to Websites with Python Flask. In this workshop we will take you through the fundamentals of creating a dynamic websites using the Python Flask library. After the workshop you should have a rough mental picture of how websites work and some good pointers for getting further with websites of your own.

We only expect you to know a little Python, like from our [Introduction to Programming](http://opentechschool.github.com/python-beginners/en/index.html) workshop. You definitely do not need to know a lot. It will be best if you have a recent version of Python installed as well (version 3 or higher).

Don't worry if you know only a little HTML or none at all. We'll be looking at how it all works rather than how to make it look pretty.

## What we'll do today

So we have this awesome idea for a website, _Cats Everywhere_, which lets people share pictures of cats *via the internet*. It's innovative, it's new, it's exciting...

But we don't have any code yet.

Instead we'll make a _landing page_, letting the internet know that a new era of cat pictures will soon begin. People can submit their email address to learn more when the real site goes live. By storing those addresses we'll have a ready-made audience when the time comes to announce the real thing.

We'll be using Python Flask as the web server. Cat lovers will be able to point their web browsers at our site, enter their email address, and hold their breath for our launch!

## A bit of history

Websites as we know them today started in 1991 from the work of Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Most websites were static content; simple HTML pages stored on disk and sent directly to the browser. If people wanted to interact with others then they would have to do it by other means, such as email or USENET.

Web servers eventually enabled programmers to write dynamic interactive websites in a variety of languages such as Perl and Python. This interface was called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) and is still found in some places, though it is generally considered too awkward for everyday use now.

Since 1996 the most common web server has been Apache HTTPD, but from the late 1990s it was possible to build dynamic websites using a number of other language-specific platforms. Popular choices were Servlets (Java), Perl, PHP, Zope (Python) and ASP (Microsoft IIS).

When the web became ubiquitous in the early 2000s many programmers were fed up with the work required to build and maintain large websites. From previous experience new platforms were built. Of these the most popular by far are Ruby on Rails and Python Django. These very large frameworks controlled the vast majority of the developer experience. Once set up they can make complicated websites very quickly, but also require a lot of experience to master.

Many developers did not require such large and complicated tools and so now we also have the _microframeworks_. As well as Flask, which we'll be using today, there are other popular microframeworks. These include:

* Sinatra (which uses the programming language Ruby).
* Express (which uses the programming language JavaScript).
* Bottle (which uses Python).

These are all small focused libraries that provide just the bare essentials, but can usually be extended into more complicated solutions.
