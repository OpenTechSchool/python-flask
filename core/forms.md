You've probably seen HTML forms a billion times already:

![HTML Sample Form](images/Sample_web_form.png)

Ok maybe not this one specifically. It is a bit weird.

Forms start with the `<form>` tag. 
This marks the start of the form area, and can surrounded basically anything inside the HTML body. 
A form area starts like this:

	<form action="/submit" method="post">

This will send a HTTP _POST_ of the form to a page (or _route_) called `/submit` on the server.

Inside the `<form>` tag there are a number of different `<input>` tags available:

## Text input

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-input.png)

The text input element allows people to type in one line of text. The input type is `text`.

	<input type="text" name="name"></input>

This will send the contents of the text box back to the server with the variable `name`.

## Radio buttons

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-radio.png)

Radio buttons allow users to select one option from many. They are named from the preset buttons on car radios.

To create some radio buttons you use the input type `radio`:

	<input type="radio" name="sex" value="male">Male</input>
	<input type="radio" name="sex" value="female">Female</input>

Here we can see that each `<input>` has a type of `radio` and _the same name_. 
It is imperative that each radio input has the same name. 
The selected radio option will be sent back to the server with variable `sex`. 
The value of that variable will be either `male` or `female`.

## Select dropdown

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-select.png)

Select input is a little trickier. The `<select>` tag groups a list of `<option>` tags. Like this:

    <select name="eyecolor">
      <option value="blue">Blue</option>
      <option value="brown">Brown</option>
      <option value="green">Green</option>
      <option value="other">Other</option>
    </select>

When sent back to the server the browser will use the variable name `eyecolor` and the value of the selected option.

There are a couple of gotchas with select boxes:

* There is no built-in way to say "Select an option..." when the user has not selected an option yet. Although this is a very common scenario, and the browser automatically selects the first option which may be confusing. In HTML you have to specifically create a `<option>` tag containing "Select an option...".
* To automatically select an option when the page loads you can use the `selected` attribute on the option, like this:

	<option selected="selected" value="blue">Blue</option>

* There is an attribute called `multiple` which allows multiple selections in the `<select>` tag. 
* The only reason I mention this is recommend **never** using it.

## Checkbox

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-checkbox.png)

A checkbox allows simple yes/no style answers for forms. 
They can be a little tricky because there are two ways to use them.

The first is simply to create a different name for each option:

	<input type="checkbox" name="height" value="1">Over 6 feet tall</input>
	<input type="checkbox" name="weight" value="1">Over 200 pounds</input>

When both are selected this will send back _two_ variables, `height` and `weight`. 
Each variable will have the value `1`.

The second is to use one name for each option:

	<input type="checkbox" name="stature" value="over6feet">Over 6 feet tall</input>
	<input type="checkbox" name="stature" value="over200pounds">Over 200 pounds</input>

When both are selected this will send back _one_ variable, `stature`, with the value `over6feet,over200pounds`. 
It is up to the server to split the value back into two separate items.

## Textarea

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-textarea.png)

When you want more than a single line of text from a user you can use the `<textarea>` tag:

	<textarea name="athletic" cols="50" rows="4"></textarea>

It even has the archaic `cols` and `rows` attributes, which hark back to the days of green-screen text terminals. 
These attributes decide the size of the textarea, but generally you should just use CSS.

## Submit button

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-submit.png)

To get everything back to the server you need a submit button:

	<input type="submit" value="Enter my information">

When clicked the browser knows it is time to submit the form data back to the server. 
The browser gathers all the data in the `<input>`, `<select>` and `<textarea>` tags and sends them to the URL mentioned in the action element of the `<form>` tag.

# From static to dynamic

This ability to request and capture content from users is what changes a website from static to dynamic. 
Just about anyone can write static content and have it hosted by a webserver. 
But to accept data from users through `<form>` (or the more complicated JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest` - i.e "ajax"), process it and store the result marks the shift from being an page author to a programmer.

Now it is time to make our website a little more interactive. 
Move on to the next chapter to see how we'll use `<form>` to collect some email addresses.
