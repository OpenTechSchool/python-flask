You've probably seen HTML forms a billion times already:

![HTML Sample Form](images/sample_web_form.png)

This one comes from the world renowned Web 2.0 startup company "The Corner Pizza Shop".

Forms start with the `<form>` tag. This marks the start of the form area, and can surround basically anything inside the HTML body. A form area starts like this:

	<form action="post.html" method="post">

This means: this form sends an HTTP _POST_ to a page on the server called `post.html`.

Inside the `<form>` tag there are a number of different `<input>` tags available:

## Text input

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-input.png)

The text input element allows people to type in one line of text. The input type is `text`.

	<input type="text" name="name"></input>

Whatever is typed into this text box will be sent to the server with the variable `name`.

## Radio buttons

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-radio.png)

Radio buttons allow users to select one option from many. They are named from the preset buttons on car radios.

To create some radio buttons you use the input type `radio`:

     <input type="radio" name="topping" value="supreme">Supreme</input>
     <input type="radio" name="topping" value="vegetarian">Vegetarian</input>
     <input type="radio" name="topping" value="hawaiian">Hawaiian</input>

Here we can see that each `<input>` has a type of `radio` and _the same name_, `topping`. It is imperative that each radio input has the same name, so they're all grouped together. The selected radio option will be sent back to the server with variable `topping`. The value of that variable will be one of the choices - `supreme`, `vegetarian` or `hawaiian`.

## Select dropdown

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-select.png)

Select input is a little trickier. The `<select>` tag groups a list of `<option>` tags. Like this:

    <select name="sauce">
        <option value="tomato">Tomato</option>
        <option value="barbeque">Barbeque</option>
        <option value="mayonnaise">Mayonnaise</option>
        <option value="secret">Secret Sauce</option>
    </select>

When sent back to the server the browser will use the variable name `sauce` and the value of the selected option.

There are a couple of gotchas with select boxes:

* There is no built-in way to say "Select an option..." when the user has not selected an option yet. Although this is a very common scenario, and the browser automatically selects the first option which may be confusing. In HTML you have to specifically create a `<option>` tag containing "Select an option...".
* To automatically select an option when the page loads you can use the `selected` attribute on the option, like this:

        <option selected="selected" value="secret">Secret Sauce</option>

* There is an attribute called `multiple` which allows multiple selections in the `<select>` tag. The only reason I mention this is recommend **never** using it.

## Checkbox

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-checkbox.png)

A checkbox allows simple yes/no style answers for forms. They can be a little tricky because there are two ways to use them.

The first is simply to create a different name for each option:

    <input type="checkbox" name="extra_cheese" value="1">Extra Cheese</input>
    <input type="checkbox" name="gluten_free" value="1">Gluten Free Base</input>

When both are selected this will send back _two_ variables, `extra_cheese` and `gluten_free`. Each variable will have the value `1` if the checkbox is checked.

The second is to use one name for each option:

    <input type="checkbox" name="extras" value="extra_cheese">Extra Cheese</input>
    <input type="checkbox" name="extras" value="gluten_free">Gluten Free Base</input>

When both are selected this will send back _one_ variable, `extras`, containing any value that is checked. Multiple values are separated by commas - ie `extra_cheese,gluten_free`. It is up to the server to split the value back into separate items.

## Textarea

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-textarea.png)

When you want more than a single line of text from a user you can use the `<textarea>` tag:

	<textarea name="delivery" cols="50" rows="4"></textarea>

It even has the archaic `cols` and `rows` attributes, which hark back to the days of green-screen text terminals. These attributes decide the size of the textarea, but generally you should just use CSS.

## Submit button

![HTML Sample Form](images/form-submit.png)

To get everything back to the server you need a submit button:

	<input type="submit" value="Send my Order">

When clicked the browser knows it is time to submit the form data back to the server. The browser gathers all the data in the `<input>`, `<select>` and `<textarea>` tags and sends them to the URL mentioned in the action element of the `<form>` tag.

# From static to dynamic

This ability to request and capture content from users is what changes a website from static to dynamic. Just about anyone can write an HTML page with static content and have it hosted by a webserver. But to accept data from users through `<form>` (or the more complicated JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest`), process it and store the result marks the shift from being an page author to a programmer.

Now it is time to make our website a little more interactive. Move on to the next chapter to see how we'll use `<form>` to collect some email addresses.
